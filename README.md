Wine is very important in the well-culturing of young men and women. In the following report we analyze a data set of 178 different wines The dataset contains 14 variables of chemical information. We perform an exploratory analysis of the data using various methods. Each of the methods enable us to draw insights and induce patterns about the region where the wine was cultivated. One might use PCA to understand which regions generally produce wine with certain characteristics. Or one might use clustering to define the regions if they were previously unknown or determine if any subgroups exist within the regions. 
The ail is to to use exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore selected wine data set for visualizations, distributions, outliers, and anomalies. The dataset has 178 records from three different classes. The distribution is seen in the following figure corresponding to 59 for class 1, 71 for class 2, and 48 for class 3
